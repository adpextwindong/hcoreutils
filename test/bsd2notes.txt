An even more simplified version has come into use, primarily known for its usage in FreeBSD.[9] It was in use there as early as April 29, 1999 [10] and likely well before. The primary difference between it and the New BSD (3-clause) License is that it omits the non-endorsement clause. The FreeBSD version of the license also adds a further disclaimer about views and opinions expressed in the software,[11] though this is not commonly included by other projects.

The Free Software Foundation, which refers to the license as the FreeBSD License, states that it is compatible with the GNU GPL. In addition, the FSF encourages users to be specific when referring to the license by name (i.e. not simply referring to it as "a BSD license" or "BSD-style"), as it does with the modified/new BSD license, to avoid confusion with the original BSD license.[8]

Other projects, such as NetBSD, use a similar 2-clause license.[12] This version has been vetted as an Open source license by the OSI as the "Simplified BSD License."[3]

The ISC license is functionally equivalent, and endorsed by the OpenBSD project as a license template for new contributions.[13]
