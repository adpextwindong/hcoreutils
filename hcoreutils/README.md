Text/shell utilities

- [basename](src/basename.hs)
- [true](src/true.hs)
- [wc](src/wc.hs) Practically done except for Character locale handling and its line count is based on ByteString's idea of lines.
- [yes](src/yes.hs)

I'll be going through [this list](https://wiki.debian.org/coreutils) and do whatever feels tackleable.

Inspired by [uutils/coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils).

See benchmarks in the benchmarks directory.
